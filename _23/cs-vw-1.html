<div id="title1"><h3>Summary</h3></div>
<div id="content1">
	<p>The VWG brands included in the project were: Audi, VW Commercial Vehicles, VW Passenger Cars, Škoda, Cupra and SEAT. Each have distinct established brand identities and it was imperative that their individual CRM communications reflected this.</p>
	<p>The existing process involved emails being designed on a bespoke basis using PhotoShop, leading to countless inefficiencies with file-handling, storage and maintenance.</p>
	<p>To implement a modular system, the base components needed to be flexible, yet share a common structure. Achieving this enabled consistent and efficient component updates, while allowing for brand libraries to be swapped easily during production.</p>
</div>
<div id="title2"><h3>Role and Duration</h3></div>
<div id="content2">
	<p>I was brought on board to fulfil the proposed solution/accepted tender for a modular-based email design system, on behalf of Ekino/Havas’ client, Volkswagen Group.</p>
	<p>With support from Product Managers, Programme & Creative Directors, and direct collaboration with Developers, I worked as Experience Lead across the entire product lifecycle, delivering a Figma-based, production-ready, multi-brand, modular email design system.</p>
	<p>The entire end-to-end project spanned almost a year, incorporating discovery & research, design & build, testing, and final handoff including full documentation and training.</p>
</div>
<div id="title3"><h3>Scope & Constraints</h3></div>
<div id="content3">
	<p>Figma was the ideal option for creating the system. Whilst I was more than comfortable with this choice, no stakeholders, collaborators, developers or designers involved had experience of the app. This added an ongoing educational requirement to the project, and led to many changes in approach and scope throughout the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="title4"><h3>Goals</h3></div>
<div id="content4">
	<p>The primary goal was to improve efficiency in designing and building customer emails. With as many as 8 variants of a single email, additional personalised and dynamic content, the PhotoShop process was extremely cumbersome and inept for purpose. Time and effort saved through the improvements not only saves on operational costs, but reduces time spent on BAU work, subsequently allowing for more time to be spent on higher-priority campaigns and creative.</p>
	<p>The system brought many additional benefits; working as a source of truth for brand styles, a central resource and archive of assets. Being cloud-based, files are widely accessible, consistent and always up to date - whilst versioning and feedback are recorded and stored automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="title5"><h3>Challenges</h3></div>
<div id="content5">
	<p>The nature of HTML emails, and lack of CSS support in email clients, rendered a token-based design system unsuitable. The final product consisted of base components in a Figma library, with a style library for each brand, which the developers translated into hard-coded html blocks on their end.</p>
	<p>Each brand created their customer emails in silo, which led to a number of discrepancies - between email types as well as between brands.</p>
</div>
<div id="title6"><h3>Discovery</h3></div>
<div id="content6">
	<p>The discovery phase allowed for examples of each email type, from each journey phase, from each brand, to be presented side-by-side for the first time. With over 5000 assets supplied, this was a lengthy process, however this "bird's eye" perspective was integral in being able to distinguish similarities and inconsistencies, and to identify common patterns.</p>
	<p>The vast array of assets were processed using a 3-step formula, as detailed below.</p>
	<!-- <p>Incidentally, the shared discovery boards became an appreciated bonus for our brand clients; providing a welcome opportunity to visualise their entire customer journeys.</p> -->
</div>
<div id="title7"><h3>Design & Development</h3></div>
<div id="content7">
	<p>Once a set of key base modules had been finalised, a “test-and-learn” approach commenced. The two VW brands (VW Passenger Cars and VW Commercial Vehicles) together offered a practical balance between similarities and differences, providing an ideal starting point for proof of concept. (testing compatibility of styles, components, platforms, devices, and demonstration of fixed vs flex components)</p>
	<p>After comprehensive iteration and testing with the developer, the foundation of the design system was formed. This provided a solid foundation from which to base the remaining component and style libraries.
	</p>
</div>
<div id="title8"><h3>Delivery & Handoff</h3></div>
<div id="content8">
	<p>The final product consisted of a Figma Enterprise-level workspace containing projects for each of the VW brands, plus a “Core” project to house the shared foundational components, styles, markup assets and documentation. This structure enabled restricted access for external users, while simultaneously allowing the content creators to utilise the central shared library approach, and swap visuals as needed.</p>
	<p>Once the system was ready to launch, I was invited to spend several days providing hands-on training for the agency’s design team, who would be using the product on a daily basis. It was both relieving and rewarding to find that the team quickly adopted the new system and instinctively transitioned their PhotoShop workflows to the new environment; testament to their skills as Digital Designers, as well as their positive, eager approach.</p>
	<p>I was conscious, as a freelance/temporary worker, that extensive documentation was pertinent to the implementation of the new system and processes. Within Figma, components & styles were carefully annotated, the system structure and updated workflows were detailed, production file templates and projects were set up, and an extensive “how-to” guide was added, covering the application of relevant Figma tools and processes. A OneNote ‘Wiki’ was created on the agency-wide Office 365 Workspace, so that users throughout the rest of the business could utilise the system, without being fully-proficient in Figma.</p>
</div>
<div id="title9"><h3>Reception</h3></div>
<div id="content9">
	<p>The email system was well-received by stakeholders and clients. As an MVP, it fulfils the objectives set out at the start of the project, and has endless potential for further optimisation and expansion.</p>
	<p>The true value of the project will take time to transpire. Legacy design files for each CRM phase will be converted to the new format in a staggered fashion, per business requirements. I’m confident that once this process is complete, with the design system evolving accordingly, its full impact and worth will become evident.</p>
</div>
<div id="title10"><h3>Learnings & Takeaways</h3></div>
<div id="content10">
	<p>The end-to-end project numerous significant challenges and blockers along the way, which at times was incredibly frustrating and disruptive. It became apparent very quickly that a flexible, opportunistic attitude was key; to sustain momentum, avoid scope diversion, maintain timelines, and to focus on producing alternative solutions through creative thinking. It highlighted the importance of communication, positivity and adaptability; pivotal takeaways for me, on a personal level.</p>
	<p>The energy and support within our agency team was immensely beneficial throughout the project. Regular communication, transparency and integrity enriched our relationships with stakeholders, instilling trust and driving success. It was a pleasure to be involved.</p>
