	<h2>Project Details</h2></div>

<div id="sam_1-1">
	<h3>Role</h3>
	<p>I was the Lead UX resource on the project, and collaborated with Product, Development and Design teams to successfully deliver this exclusive customer rewards experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="sam_1-2">
	<h3>Scope & Constraints</h3>
	<p>The flagship loyalty programme was a first for Samsung UK. As it was exclusive to S21 device owners, most of the experience would be mobile-based. However, inclusion of desktop access points point was essential for discovery and acquisition.</p>
	<p>Users would be presented with aspirational marketing content for the scheme, as well as relevant messaging and signposting based on the scenario.</p>
	<p>Redemption methods differed between partners ranging from promo code entry, to tokenised signup, to hard-coded download links. Claiming an offer from the Offer Detail Page would launch an iframe within the Samsung mobile platform, in which the third-party process would be contained. Following redemption, users are returned to Boost to continue their experience.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_1-3">
	<h2>Goals & Challenges</h2></div>

<div id="sam_1-4">	
	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>Entice new customers to purchase the flagship Galaxy S21 device.<br />
Drive engagement and deliver added-value to existing customers.<br />
Promote upgrade and trade-in options to incentivise conversion.<br />
Generate awareness of in-house Samsung services, as well as partner products and services.</p>
</div>
<div id="sam_1-5">
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>Short turnaround time (~8 weeks).<br />
Many technical specifications unknown until well after project kick-off.<br />
Combinations of internal and external data and processes.<br />
Balancing informational and aspirational objectives of landing pages, to accommodate varying users and scenarios.

<div id="sam_2-0"><h2>The UX Process</h2></div>
<div id="sam_2-1">
	<h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
	<p>Researching comparable online rewards schemes<br />
	Analysis of examples and best-practice for restricted content UX<br />
	Capturing and composing each partner’s own redemption flow using screenshots<br />
	Defining data requirements for each stage of the journey</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-2">
	<h3>Insight</h3>
	<p>Regardless of the partner-specific offer or redemption process, the journey should be intuitive, as seamless as possible, and contextually familiar.</p>
	<p>Any user, in any scenario, should feel enticed, empowered, and enabled; not confused, dejected, or blocked.</p>
	<p>They should be informed of all available options and incentivised to convert.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-3">
	<h3>Defining the Customer Journey</h3>
	<p>Mapping out the customer journey using an empathy map (of sorts), was essential in ideating the optimal user experience outside of technical restrictions.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-4">
	<h3>Flow Diagramming</h3>
	<p>As technical unknowns became resolved, user flow adjustments were made to bring usability, logic and tech affordances into alignment. Various use cases and scenarios were included to present the full experience overview.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-5">
	<h3>Prototypes</h3>
	<p>A lo-fi click-through prototype of the basic linear flow progressed to a higher-fidelity demonstration of full e2e journeys and interactions. These aided Product and Design teams, as well as senior management, to better understand the e2e journey.</p>
