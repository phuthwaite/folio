	<h2>Project Details</h2></div>

<div id="sam_1-1">
	<h3>Role</h3>
	<p>I was the Lead UX resource on the project, and collaborated with Product, Development and Design teams to successfully deliver this exclusive customer rewards experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="sam_1-2">
	<h3>Scope & Constraints</h3>
	<p>The flagship loyalty programme was a first for Samsung UK. As it was exclusive to S21 device owners, most of the experience would be mobile-based. However, inclusion of desktop access points point was essential for discovery and acquisition.</p>
	<p>Users would be presented with aspirational marketing content for the scheme, as well as relevant messaging and signposting based on the scenario.</p>
	<p>Redemption methods differed between partners ranging from promo code entry, to tokenised signup, to hard-coded download links. Claiming an offer from the Offer Detail Page would launch an iframe within the Samsung mobile platform, in which the third-party process would be contained. Following redemption, users are returned to Boost to continue their experience.</p>

<div id="sam_2-0"><h2>The UX Process</h2></div>
<div id="sam_2-1">
	<h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
	<p>Following project kick-off with Dev and Product, the UX research and discovery phase began. This involved:<br />
	- Researching comparable online rewards and loyalty schemes<br />
	- Analysis of examples and UX best-practices for restricted content<br />
	- Capturing and composing each partner’s own redemption flow using screenshots<br />
	- Defining system and data validation requirements for each stage of the journey</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-2">
	<h3>Insight</h3>
	<p>Regardless of the partner-specific offer or redemption process, the journey should be <b>intuitive</b>, as <b>seamless</b> as possible, and contextually <b>familiar</b>.</p>
	<p>Any user, in any scenario, should feel <b>enticed</b>, <b>empowered</b>, and <b>enabled</b>; not confused, dejected, or blocked.</p>
	<p>They should be <b>informed</b> of all available options and <b>incentivised</b> to convert.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-3">
	<h3>Defining the Customer Journey</h3>
	<p>Mapping out the customer journey using an empathy map (of sorts), was essential in ideating the optimal user experience outside of any technical restrictions.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-4">
	<h3>Flow Diagramming & Wireframing</h3>
	<p>As technical unknowns became resolved, user flow adjustments were made to bring usability, logic and tech affordances into alignment. Various use cases and scenarios were included to present the full experience overview.</p>
	<p>Wireframes illustrated how and what content should be shown at each stage of the flow. A modular approach to content allowed for sections to be easily swapped or removed, according to the use case.</p>
</div>

<div id="sam_2-5">
	<h3>Prototypes</h3>
	<p>A lo-fi click-through prototype of the basic linear flow progressed to a higher-fidelity demonstration of full e2e journeys and interactions. These aided Product and Design teams, as well as senior management, to better understand the e2e journey.</p>
