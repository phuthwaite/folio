	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Volkswagen Group is the leading automotive company in the UK, comprising six high-profile, distinguished brands: <b>Volkswagen [Passenger Cars]</b>, <b>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles</b>, <b>Audi</b>, <b>Škoda</b>, <b>SEAT</b> and <b>Cupra</b>.</p>
	<p>Each brand has its own distinct, established visual identity and it was imperative that individual CRM communications created using the design system reflected this.</p>
	<p>The existing process involved emails being designed on a bespoke basis using Photoshop, leading to countless inefficiencies concerning file-handling, storage, accessibility, and maintenance. Content amends required PSDs to be updated and re-distributed - compounding those issues even further.</p>
	<p>Base components needed to share a common underlying structure, but be flexible enough to accommodate varying style/layout specifications. Achieving this enabled consistent and efficient component updates, while allowing for brand libraries to be swapped easily during production.</p>

	<h2>2. Project Details</h2></div>
<div id="_2-1">
	<h3>Role & Responsibilities</h3>
	<p>I was brought on board to fulfil the accepted tender for a modular-based email design system, Ekino/Havas’ client, Volkswagen Group UK.</p>
	<p>With support from Product Managers, Programme & Creative Directors, and direct collaboration with Developers, I worked as Experience Lead across the entire product lifecycle, delivering a Figma-based, production-ready, multi-brand, modular email design system.</p>
	<p>The whole end-to-end project spanned almost a year, incorporating discovery & research, MVP design & build, and final handoff including full documentation and training.</p>
</div>
<div id="_2-2">
	<h3>Scope & Constraints</h3>
	<p>The MVP scope was limited to a like-for-like recreation of a set of existing emails/modules, for selected key VWG brands and sub-brands.
	</p>
	<p>
	Figma had been elected as the platform for the new system - an ideal choice. However, knowledge and experience of Figma was extremely limited amongst the rest of the parties involved int he project. This added an ongoing educational requirement, and led to many adjustments in approach and scope throughout the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="_2-3">
	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>The primary goal was to improve efficiency in the production of customer emails. Multiple variants of a single email design, reflecting variances in personalised and dynamic content, which had to be updated and re-supplied with every single content update (including text amends) resulted in countless PSDs being circulated for evey job. This outdated Photoshop-based workflow was extremely cumbersome and inept for purpose. The new modular system would save time and effort, in turn reducing operational costs and freeing resources to focus on higher-priority campaigns and innovation. Further benefits were abundant; a single source of truth for brand styles, a central asset resource, a design archive. Being cloud-based, files are easily accessible and continuously synced - with version history and feedback recorded and stored automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="_2-4">
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>The primitive nature of HTML emails and lack of universal CSS support ruled-out a token based system. To preserve interoperability and maximise efficiency, emphasis was placed on the structure of the libraries and contents. The developers translated components into hard-coded html blocks, which limited the scope for creative freedom within designs - perhaps not a bad thing!</p>
	<p>Individual emails were previously created in silo, leading to extensive design discrepancies. While full redesigns were not part of the project scope, many design decisions and creative amendments were necessary in order to achieve standardisation and consistency.</p>

	<h2>3. Discovery</h2></div>
<div id="_3-1">
	<p>The discovery phase allowed for examples of each email type, from each journey phase, from each brand, to be presented side-by-side for the first time. With over 5000 assets supplied, this was a lengthy process, however this "bird's eye" perspective was integral in being able to distinguish similarities and inconsistencies, and to identify common patterns.</p>
	<p>The vast array of assets were processed using a 3-step formula...</p>
</div>

<div id="_3-2">
	<img class="object-fit-cover" src="img/cs/vw/vw-disco-1-data.png">
	<h3>1. Asset Organisation</h3>
	<p>Assets were supplied using inconsistent naming conventions and folder structures. Creating an Airtable database of all files and adding metadata helped establish a categorisation strategy, which aided taxonomy, documentation and tracking in later stages of the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="_3-3">
	<img class="object-fit-cover" src="img/cs/vw/vw-disco-2-sheet.png">
	<h3>2. Template/Journey Mapping</h3>
	<p>Each brand's CRM journey and touchpoint data was compiled in a master spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was then embedded into Miro artboards, where email screenshots had been assembled, enabling cross-referencing of designs, content requirements and overall customer experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="_3-4">
	<img class="object-fit-cover" src="img/cs/vw/vw-disco-3-analysis.png">
	<h3>3. Analysis</h3>
	<p>Once the assets had been analysed, key examples of distinct templates were brought into Figma and converted to basic wireframes. This provided a bare-bones illustration of each template's content structure and hierarchy, from which optimisations [consolidation opportunities] and fundamentals [requirements] could be derived.</p>

</div>
<div id="_4-1">

		<h3>Structure</h3>
			<p class="text-wrap">
				Creating an intuitive, usable system from scratch within the Figma framework was a comprehensive task that generated hundreds of possible configurations. With so many variables, and no existing system to reference, a huge amount of time was spent exploring options in meticulous detail; constantly being reviewed and iterated as the project developed.
				<br /><br />
				Structure, hierarchy and organisation in the Figma App, generally, is somewhat limited, adding another layer of complexity to an already complicated product. Typically, folder structures on servers or apps allow unlimited folders and nested sub-folders. Conversely, Figma only offers 3 levels of hierarchy, in a fixed structure: Team > Project > File.
				<br /><br />
				Production content was listed out in a sitemap format to assess grouping and categorisation, optimised for Production workflow, covering design, review, handoff, and archive purposes.
				<br /><br />
				The "behind the scenes" system architecture was planned using post-it notes to map out library components, relationships and organisation. Post-its were also used to visualise each brand library, to highlight and track individual nuances/requirements, bugs/issues key deliverables.

	<h2>5. Design & Development</h2>
</div>
<div id="_5-1">
	<h3>Components & Styles</h3>
	<p>Once a set of key modules had been selected for the MVP, the design & development phase was initiated with a “start-small" / "test-and-learn” approach. The two VW brands (Volkswagen [Passenger Cars] and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles) offered a practical balance of similarities / differences, providing an ideal starting point for proof of concept.</p>
	<p>A comprehensive process tested the compatibility of components, distinct visual styles, platforms, devices, and fixed vs flex coding, through increasing levels of fidelity. Eventually this led to the foundation of the design system; the "Core Library" (also known as base library/base components). It would be duplicated for each new brand/sub-brand, then the content edited to align with the visual identity. For this project, another round of testing/iterating would commence once a new library was created. Local issues were quickly fixed and retested, and - due to the amount of work involved with amending and retesting - any global issues were only effected after assessing the overall necessity and impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="_5-2">
	<h3>Specification</h3>
	<p>Figma library components were 

	Detailed design specs for mobile and desktop components were  the build phase. These properties were pre-built into the figma library components, however for clarity and reference the design specs were also included in the documentation.</p>

<div id="_6-0">
	<h2>6. MVP</h2>
</div>
<div id="_6-1">
	<p>The multi-faceted MVP consisted of the following types of content...</p>
</div>
<div id="_6-2">
	<h3>Core Library: Base Components & Styles</h3>
	<p>This is the foundation of the whole system. Every modular component and style used throughout the system is derived from this core library. Additionally, the basic elements and generic styles serve as a lo-fidelity unbranded design resource.</p>
</div>
<div id="_6-3">
	<h3>Brand Libraries</h3>
	<p>Each distinctive brand and sub-brand has it's own library instance, set up within a brand "Team" in Figma. Properties and attributes defined in the original core library cascade to child library elements; enabling brand-switching through Figma's library-swapping feature.</p>
</div>
<div id="_6-4">
	<h3>Production Templates</h3>
	<p>Template files provide a "quick start" for email projects - configured with the correct library linkage and page structure - streamlining the process and aiding consistency.</p>
</div>
<div id="_6-5">
	<h3>Documentation</h3>
	<p>Extensive documentation of all components and styles, noting key brand variances and usage rules or restrictions, was added to each brand's "Team" space. A One-Note "wiki" was also created to serve as a non-technical guide, accessible to the wider business through Sharepoint.</p>
</div>
<div id="_6-6">
	<h3>Additional Assets</h3>
	<p>A compilation of quick tips, Figma tutorial links, useful shortcuts and plugins, and relevant workflow and process guides was added to the system, to assist designers going forward. A markup library was also included for handoff annotations and specs.</p>
</div>

	<h2>7. Delivery & Handoff</h2></div>
<div id="_7-1">
	<h3>Training</h3>
	<p>Once the system was ready to launch, I was invited to spend several days providing hands-on training for the agency’s design team, who would be using the product on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>The team quickly adopted the new system; instinctively transitioning former practices from Photoshop to Figma with ease. This was testament to their skills as digital designers, complemented by their enthusiastic approach.</p>

	<h2>8. Reception</h2></div>
<div id="_8-1">
	<h3>Result</h3>
	<p>The design system fulfils the objectives set out at the start of the project. There is boundless potential for further optimisation and expansion - with minimal LOE. The MVP was well-received by stakeholders and clients; attracting positive feedback and eagerness for implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="_8-2">
	<h3>Governance & Evolution</h3>
	<p>The true value of the project will take time to transpire. Legacy design files for existing emails/journeys beyond the MVP scope will be converted to the new format in a staggered fashion, per business requirements. I’m confident that once this process is complete, with the design system growing and evolving accordingly, its full impact and worth will be fully realised.</p>
</div>
<div id="_8-3">
	<h3>Unexpected Wins! 😀</h3>
	<p>Artifacts created as part of the discovery phase were shared with clients, on request, following one of the early progress check-ins. Those assets provided unexpected, but valuable, CX insights to several parties, for which their gratitude and appreciation were expressed. This helped establish a favourable outlook early-on; boosting confidence in both the project and team, whilst bringing added value to the clients' investment.</p>

	<h2>9. Learnings & Takeaways</h2>
</div>
<div id="_9-1">
	<!-- <h3>Retrospective</h3> -->
	<p>Each stage of the project presented challenges and blockers. Alternative solutions and workarounds were a regular occurrence. Although frustrating and disruptive, adopting a versatile and dynamic attitude paved the way for effective solutionising through creative thinking and problem solving; vital to sustain momentum, minimise scope deviation and ultimately drive success. And to help retain a small shred of sanity.</p>

	<p>Open, frequent communication with the development team, and their willingness to collaborate, was incredibly advantageous. 3x weekly standups aided productivity and alignment at a team level, whilst a direct webchat channel between the developer and myself enhanced efficiency; minor queries or concerns could be addressed without unecessary delay or escalation. This was instrumental in achieving very tight turnarounds in the latter stages of the project. Having worked in several roles previously where direct contact with devs was discouraged or even prohibited, this was a refreshing change.</p>

	<p>Transparency, enthusiasm and integrity enriched working relationships with clients and peers alike. I was fortunate to be working with a superb internal team (especially the Product Manager), who provided the perfect blend of support, assistance and autonomy from start to finish. Furthermore, the energy and rapport within the wider agency UXD team was immensely beneficial - bringing creativity, inspiration, knowledge-sharing and social opportunities to a predominantly solo, non-creative role.</p>

	<p>All of these factors culminated in a very enjoyable and fulfilling contracting experience.</p>
